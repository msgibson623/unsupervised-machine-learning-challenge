# unsupervised-machine-learning-challenge
Marcus Assignment #20

For this assignment I'm on the data science team of a medical research company that’s interested in finding better ways to predict myopia, or nearsightedness. My team has tried—and failed—to improve their classification model when training on the whole dataset. However, they believe that there might be distinct groups of patients that would be better to analyze separately. So, my supervisor has asked me to explore this possibility by using unsupervised learning.

i have been provided with raw data, so I first process the data to fit the machine learning models. I then use several clustering algorithms to explore whether the patients can be placed into distinct groups. Then, I create a visualization to share my findings teammates and other key stakeholders.
